Blog created just for studying purposes. 

4:3 Gaming Blog is a blog about retro gaming, where I talk about video game consoles from the very first Magnavox Odyssey until the 16bits classics Super Nintendo and SEGA Mega Drive (Genesis).

I'm using HTML, CSS, Javascript and PHP for this project.
It is meant to be imported to Wordpress after I'm done with the pages layouts so the pages I've done so far were just for a template purpose.

As frameworks I'm using:
NES.css - NES-style CSS Framework for the retro look style
Animate.css for animations
NeptunJS Online Emulator for emulating games

For fonts I'm using two google fonts:
Press Start 2P for titles
Montserrat for paragraphs

Since i'm coding in php format, I recommend you to install MAMP if you want to run the code locally. While it's not in WordPress, I'm hosting at:
